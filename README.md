Game features and ideas:

BEFORE I START: This game is going to be probably one of the worst made games ever, but it's ok. The point of this game is to get familiar with programming again and just having a little fun without sarah.

Basic game goals:
- Playable character...his name being Rammi...yessss....
- Rammi's goal is that he needs to buy supplies from one place and transport to another... kinda like a simple static trading game??
- Rammi will encounter enemies and bandits and will fight them off
  maybe thru text or something similar to Undertale since I like the
  type of fighting mechanic.
- For the map, I spent some time earlier this summer(summer before
  freshman year) learning about 2D procedural terrain, so maybe I can
  do something like that, or maybe I will draw my own map. 

 Implemented Features:
